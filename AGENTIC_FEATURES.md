# Agentic Intelligence Features

Your Discord bot now includes enterprise-grade agentic intelligence capabilities that transform it from a simple AI responder into a proactive, self-improving digital teammate.

## üß† What is Agentic Intelligence?

Agentic AI goes beyond simple question-answering. It's an AI system that:

- **Learns continuously** from interactions and feedback
- **Makes proactive decisions** about when to escalate or seek clarification
- **Provides transparency** through source citations and confidence scores
- **Adapts to community norms** and user preferences
- **Self-improves** through feedback loops and analytics

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Knowledge Base Management
- **Add Knowledge**: Use `/learn` to teach the AI new information
- **Search Knowledge**: Use `/knowledge` to find relevant information
- **Automatic Learning**: The AI learns from moderator interactions

### 2. Smart Flagging & Escalation
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies uncertain responses and potential issues
- **Intelligent Escalation**: Routes complex queries to human moderators
- **Manual Escalation**: Use `/escalate` to manually escalate any query

### 3. Source Citations & Transparency
- **Source Attribution**: Every response cites its information sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Shows confidence level for each response
- **Transparency**: Users know when information comes from trusted sources

### 4. Analytics & Monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response quality and user satisfaction
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor bot usage patterns and popular queries
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system health and performance data

## üìã Commands

### Core Commands
- `/optin [prompt]` - Get AI assistance with agentic intelligence
- `/agentic-help` - Get help with agentic features

### Knowledge Management
- `/learn <question> <answer> [tags]` - Add knowledge to the AI system
- `/knowledge <query>` - Search the knowledge base

### Escalation & Support
- `/escalate <query> [reason]` - Manually escalate a query to moderators

### Analytics & Configuration
- `/agentic-stats` - View system statistics and performance
- `/agentic-config` - Configure AI behavior and thresholds

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable/disable agentic intelligence
ENABLE_AGENTIC_INTELLIGENCE=true

# Designated channels for agentic responses
AGENTIC_CHANNELS=channel_id_1,channel_id_2

# Escalation channel for moderator notifications
AGENTIC_ESCALATION_CHANNEL=moderator_channel_id

# Moderator role IDs for escalation
AGENTIC_MODERATOR_ROLES=moderator_role_id_1,moderator_role_id_2
```

### Channel Configuration

1. **Designated Channels**: Set `AGENTIC_CHANNELS` to specify which channels the bot should monitor for natural conversations
2. **Escalation Channel**: Set `AGENTIC_ESCALATION_CHANNEL` for moderator notifications
3. **Moderator Roles**: Set `AGENTIC_MODERATOR_ROLES` to define who can manage escalations

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. Query Processing
When a user asks a question (via `/optin` or mentions):

1. **Knowledge Check**: Searches the knowledge base for relevant information
2. **Response Generation**: Generates a response using the best available information
3. **Quality Assessment**: Analyzes response quality and confidence
4. **Citation Generation**: Finds and cites relevant sources
5. **Escalation Decision**: Determines if human intervention is needed

### 2. Smart Flagging
The system automatically flags responses that:
- Lack grounded knowledge
- Express uncertainty
- Contain potentially harmful content
- Have poor quality indicators
- May not be appropriate for the context

### 3. Escalation Process
When escalation is needed:
1. **Ticket Creation**: Creates an escalation ticket with context
2. **Moderator Notification**: Notifies moderators in the designated channel
3. **User Notification**: Informs the user that their query is being escalated
4. **Resolution Tracking**: Tracks escalation resolution and learns from outcomes

### 4. Continuous Learning
The system learns from:
- **Moderator Interactions**: When moderators provide responses, they're added to the knowledge base
- **User Feedback**: Implicit feedback through user behavior
- **Escalation Outcomes**: Learning from what queries needed human intervention
- **Performance Analytics**: Improving based on response quality metrics

## üìä Analytics Dashboard

Access analytics at `/analytics` (if enabled) to view:
- Response quality metrics
- Knowledge base statistics
- Escalation rates and reasons
- User engagement patterns
- System performance data

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

- **Data Minimization**: Only stores necessary interaction data
- **User Control**: Users can request data deletion
- **Secure Storage**: All data is encrypted and securely stored
- **Compliance**: Designed to comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations

## üöÄ Deployment

### Railway (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Set environment variables
railway variables set ENABLE_AGENTIC_INTELLIGENCE=true
railway variables set AGENTIC_CHANNELS=your_channel_ids
```

### Other Platforms
The bot works on any Node.js hosting platform. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Commands Not Registering**
   - Check `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - Ensure bot has proper permissions

2. **Knowledge Base Not Working**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify Prisma schema is up to date

3. **Escalation Not Working**
   - Check `AGENTIC_ESCALATION_CHANNEL` is set
   - Verify moderator roles are configured

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor rate limits
   - Check API key quotas
   - Review analytics for bottlenecks

### Getting Help

- Use `/agentic-help` for in-bot assistance
- Check the health endpoint at `/health`
- Review logs for detailed error information
- Contact support with specific error messages

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a few designated channels
2. **Train Gradually**: Add knowledge over time as the community grows
3. **Monitor Escalations**: Review escalation patterns to improve the system
4. **Engage Moderators**: Ensure moderators understand the escalation process
5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review analytics and adjust configuration

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic translation and multilingual responses
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive analytics and trend analysis
- **Custom Workflows**: Community-specific automation and workflows
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external tools and services
- **Advanced Learning**: More sophisticated learning algorithms
