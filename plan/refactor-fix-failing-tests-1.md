# Introduction

This plan outlines the steps to resolve the remaining test failures in the project. The primary focus is on fixing the business logic and test expectation mismatches in `smart-context-orchestrator.test.ts` and `personalization-intelligence.test.ts`. This will involve refactoring the relevant services to meet the test requirements and ensure overall system stability.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: All tests in the suite must pass.
- **REQ-002**: The `SmartContextOrchestratorService` must produce context with confidence scores, sources, and knowledge depth that align with the test expectations.
- **REQ-003**: The `PersonalizationEngine` must generate the correct number and type of recommendations based on user patterns.
- **CON-001**: All changes must be made in a way that does not introduce new regressions.
- **GUD-001**: Follow existing coding patterns and architectural principles.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1: Fix `SmartContextOrchestratorService` Tests

- GOAL-001: Resolve all 7 failing tests in `src/services/enhanced-intelligence/__tests__/smart-context-orchestrator.test.ts`.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Analyze `SmartContextOrchestratorService` to understand why confidence scores are not meeting expectations. | | |
| TASK-002 | Refactor the confidence score calculation logic to produce the expected values. | | |
| TASK-003 | Fix the `should handle real-time information needs` test by ensuring `realTimeData` is correctly set. | | |
| TASK-004 | Correct the `enhancedPrompt` generation to include "USER EXPERTISE CONTEXT" for the expertise adaptation test. | | |
| TASK-005 | Ensure `content-extraction` is correctly added as a context source for the URL content extraction test. | | |
| TASK-006 | Adjust the fallback logic to produce a confidence score less than 0.5 when MCP tools fail. | | |
| TASK-007 | Fix the knowledge depth determination logic to correctly identify 'expert' level. | | |
| TASK-008 | Correct the logic for the `should optimize strategy based on message complexity` test. | | |
| TASK-009 | Run the test suite for `smart-context-orchestrator.test.ts` to verify all tests pass. | | |

### Implementation Phase 2: Fix `PersonalizationEngine` Test

- GOAL-002: Resolve the failing test in `src/services/enhanced-intelligence/__tests__/personalization-intelligence.test.ts`.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-010 | Analyze the `PersonalizationEngine` to understand why it's generating 2 recommendations instead of 3. | | |
| TASK-011 | Refactor the recommendation generation logic to produce the expected number of recommendations. | | |
| TASK-012 | Run the test suite for `personalization-intelligence.test.ts` to verify the test passes. | | |

### Implementation Phase 3: Final Verification

- GOAL-003: Ensure the entire test suite passes and the system is stable.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-013 | Run the entire test suite (`npm test`) and confirm all 51 suites pass. | | |
| TASK-014 | Manually test the `/chat` command to ensure the bot remains responsive and functional. | | |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Disable the failing tests temporarily. This was rejected as it would hide existing issues and lead to technical debt.
- **ALT-002**: Rewrite the tests to match the current implementation. This was rejected because the tests represent the desired behavior, and the implementation is what needs to be corrected.

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: A working Node.js and `npm` environment.
- **DEP-002**: All `npm` dependencies installed (`npm install`).

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `src/services/enhanced-intelligence/smart-context-orchestrator.service.ts`
- **FILE-002**: `src/services/enhanced-intelligence/__tests__/smart-context-orchestrator.test.ts`
- **FILE-003**: `src/services/enhanced-intelligence/personalization-engine.service.ts`
- **FILE-004**: `src/services/enhanced-intelligence/__tests__/personalization-intelligence.test.ts`

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: The existing Jest test suites will be used to verify the fixes. No new tests are required for this plan, but existing tests will be heavily relied upon.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: The refactoring of the services might inadvertently affect other parts of the system. This will be mitigated by running the full test suite.
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: The existing tests accurately reflect the desired functionality of the system.
