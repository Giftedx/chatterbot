# Introduction

This plan outlines the cleanup of legacy services and modernization of documentation to align with the current CoreIntelligenceService architecture. The bot has evolved from UnifiedIntelligenceService (/optin) to CoreIntelligenceService (/chat), but legacy code and outdated documentation remain. This cleanup will eliminate technical debt, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the codebase and documentation.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Remove all unused legacy UnifiedIntelligenceService code and /optin command references
- **REQ-002**: Update all documentation to reflect current CoreIntelligenceService + /chat architecture  
- **REQ-003**: Preserve all functional capabilities while cleaning up unused code
- **REQ-004**: Maintain backward compatibility for any external integrations
- **REQ-005**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage is maintained after cleanup
- **SEC-001**: Verify no security-sensitive legacy code remains accessible
- **SEC-002**: Validate that cleanup doesn't expose any security vulnerabilities
- **CON-001**: Cleanup must not impact production functionality or user experience
- **CON-002**: All changes must be reversible through version control
- **CON-003**: Legacy service removal must be complete to avoid confusion
- **GUD-001**: Follow established ESM module patterns and .js import requirements
- **GUD-002**: Maintain consistent code style and documentation standards
- **PAT-001**: Use systematic file-by-file cleanup approach to minimize risk
- **PAT-002**: Update documentation atomically to prevent inconsistencies

## 2. Implementation Steps

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Keep legacy services as deprecated but functional. This was rejected as it creates ongoing maintenance burden and confusion for developers.
- **ALT-002**: Gradual deprecation over multiple releases. This was rejected as the legacy services are already unused and can be safely removed immediately.
- **ALT-003**: Refactor legacy services to use new architecture. This was rejected as the functionality is already properly implemented in CoreIntelligenceService.

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Current CoreIntelligenceService must remain fully functional during cleanup
- **DEP-002**: Git version control system for safe rollback capabilities
- **DEP-003**: TypeScript compiler for validation of changes
- **DEP-004**: Jest testing framework for comprehensive test validation
- **DEP-005**: ESLint and prettier for code quality maintenance during cleanup
- **DEP-006**: All documentation files must be accessible for updates

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: src/services/unified-intelligence.service.ts - Legacy service to be removed
- **FILE-002**: src/services/unified-intelligence.service.js - Compiled output to be cleaned up
- **FILE-003**: README.md - Main documentation requiring /chat command updates
- **FILE-004**: DEPLOYMENT.md - Deployment checklist requiring command updates
- **FILE-005**: ENHANCED_INTELLIGENCE_SETUP.md - Setup guide requiring architecture updates
- **FILE-006**: .github/copilot-instructions.md - AI agent instructions requiring updates
- **FILE-007**: MCP_INTEGRATION_DEMO.md - Demo documentation requiring command updates  
- **FILE-008**: src/services/**tests**/unified-intelligence.test.ts - Legacy test files to remove
- **FILE-009**: Any additional documentation files with /optin or UnifiedIntelligenceService references

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Comprehensive grep search to verify all legacy references are removed
- **TEST-002**: Full TypeScript compilation test to ensure no import errors
- **TEST-003**: Complete Jest test suite execution to verify no functionality regressions
- **TEST-004**: End-to-end testing of /chat command to ensure full functionality
- **TEST-005**: Documentation verification tests to ensure all examples work correctly
- **TEST-006**: Integration tests to verify CoreIntelligenceService remains fully functional

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Legacy services might have hidden dependencies not identified in initial analysis. Mitigation: Comprehensive dependency mapping before removal.
- **RISK-002**: Documentation updates might introduce new inconsistencies. Mitigation: Systematic review and validation of all updated documentation.
- **RISK-003**: Test removal might eliminate useful test patterns. Mitigation: Review legacy tests for reusable patterns before deletion.
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: UnifiedIntelligenceService is truly unused in production based on index.ts analysis
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: All /optin command references are legacy and can be safely updated to /chat
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Current test infrastructure can adequately validate the cleanup
