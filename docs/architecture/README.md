# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural design documents and modularization strategies for the Discord Gemini Bot.

## Documents

### `MODULARIZATION_CONTINUATION_PROMPT.md`
Detailed strategy for converting the monolithic bot structure into a modular, maintainable architecture.

### `MODULARIZATION_SESSION_2_PROMPT.md` 
Second phase of modularization planning, focusing on service separation and dependency management.

### `MODULARIZATION_SESSION_3_PROMPT.md`
Final implementation phase of the modular architecture with comprehensive service integration.

### `PHASE_3_ARCHITECTURE.md`
Phase 3 architectural overview documenting the unified intelligence service design.

## Key Architectural Concepts

- **Unified Intelligence Service**: Single entry point that orchestrates all bot capabilities
- **Modular Service Design**: Separate services for permissions, analysis, capabilities, admin functions
- **RBAC Integration**: Enterprise-grade role-based access control
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for performance and maintainability
