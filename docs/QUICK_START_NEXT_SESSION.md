# ðŸš€ QUICK START FOR NEXT IMPLEMENTATION SESSION

## What to tell the next AI:

**"Continue implementing Phase 3 of the Discord Bot MCP integration. The comprehensive implementation guide is in `/docs/NEXT_CHAT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`. Start with Task 1 (Memory Integration) by editing `/src/services/enhanced-intelligence/mcp-tools.service.ts` and replacing the TODO placeholders with real MCP function calls. The framework is complete and ready - just need to connect the actual MCP tools."**

## Key Context:
- âœ… 273/273 tests passing  
- âœ… Complete MCP framework built
- âœ… All MCP tools available as functions
- ðŸ”„ Ready for real tool connections

## Priority Order:
1. Memory Tools (searchUserMemory method)
2. Web Search (processWebIntelligence method)  
3. Content Extraction (processUrls method)
4. Sequential Thinking (performComplexReasoning method)
5. Browser Automation (performBrowserAutomation method)

## Target File:
`/src/services/enhanced-intelligence/mcp-tools.service.ts`

## Success Metrics:
- Tests still pass (273/273)
- TypeScript compiles cleanly
- Bot starts without errors
- Real MCP tools execute successfully

**The foundation is solid - time to connect the real tools!**
