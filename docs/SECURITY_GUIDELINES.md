# Security Guidelines for Documentation Updates

This document outlines security considerations related to documentation generation and updates in this repository.

- Runtime documentation updates are a Security Risk and are prohibited in production code paths.
- Documentation content and updates should be handled exclusively by build and deployment processes, CI/CD pipelines, or developer tooling â€” not by the running application.
- The application must not accept runtime flags or environment variables to enable documentation mutation.

Prohibited patterns:
- Using environment variables such as ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES to toggle writing to Markdown files at runtime
- Writing to README files or any docs/ content during request handling
- Executing shell commands that mutate documentation (e.g., git commit docs) at runtime

Allowed patterns:
- Generating docs via TypeDoc during build
- Committing documentation updates through standard development workflows
- CI steps that generate and publish documentation to a static site or artifact storage

Verification:
- Security tests ensure that no runtime code references ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES and that suspicious file write patterns to documentation do not appear in application code paths.
