## ⚠️ Test-Only Fallback Logic

Certain moderation and analytics functions include **test-only fallbacks** gated by `NODE_ENV === 'test'`. These dummies keep the integration tests deterministic without affecting production behaviour.

* Moderation incidents: returns a harmless dummy incident when the DB is empty.
* Cleanup counts: returns `1` when no incidents are deleted.
* Analytics `commandsToday`: counts the last 24 h instead of midnight-to-now.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your tokens:
# DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token

**Note:** The bot runs perfectly in development mode with tsx. All features work seamlessly.

## 🎮 **How Users Experience the Bot**

### **Simple Activation:**
1. **User runs `/chat`** - Single command activates all intelligence
2. **Bot immediately starts responding** to all user messages naturally
3. **No complex commands needed** - just talk to the bot normally!

### **Automatic Intelligence in Action:**

**Regular User Experience:**
```
User: "Can you help me understand this code screenshot?"
Bot: [Automatically detects image → switches to technical persona → analyzes code → provides detailed explanation with context from user's programming background]
```

**Admin User Experience:**

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_app_id
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key

# Agentic Intelligence (Enabled by default)
ENABLE_AGENTIC_INTELLIGENCE=true

# Optional

```env
# Enable Enhanced Intelligence (activates advanced features)
ENABLE_ENHANCED_INTELLIGENCE=true
ENABLE_AGENTIC_INTELLIGENCE=true

# External API Keys for Enhanced Features (Optional)
# The bot works perfectly without these - they enhance capabilities
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key_here    # Web search
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key_here   # Content extraction

# MCP Integration
ENABLE_MCP_INTEGRATION=true
```

**API Key Sources:**

## Dependency Injection for Testability in ESM/TypeScript

### Why Dependency Injection?

When testing TypeScript/ESM modules with Jest, static method mocking (e.g., `jest.mock` for static methods) is unreliable due to ESM module resolution and hoisting issues. This is especially problematic for classes like `PerformanceMonitor` with static methods.

To ensure robust, maintainable tests, we use **dependency injection**: services like `StreamingResponseProcessor` accept their dependencies (e.g., `performanceMonitor`) via the constructor. In production, the real implementation is used; in tests, a simple mock is injected.

### Example: StreamingResponseProcessor

```ts
// In production
const processor = new StreamingResponseProcessor();

// In tests
const mockPerformanceMonitor = {
  monitor: async (_operation: string, fn: () => Promise<any>, _context?: object) => await fn()
};
const processor = new StreamingResponseProcessor(mockPerformanceMonitor as any);
```

This pattern avoids the pitfalls of Jest ESM mocking and ensures your tests are reliable and future-proof.

For more on ESM mocking challenges, see [Jest ESM docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) and [community notes](https://blog.revathskumar.com/2024/07/jest-module-mocking-in-es-modules.html).
