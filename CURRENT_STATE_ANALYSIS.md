## üö® **REMAINING ISSUES ANALYSIS**

### **7 Failing Test Suites Breakdown:**

#### **Non-Critical Runtime Issues (5 suites):**
- `smart-context-orchestrator.test.ts` - Mock expectation mismatches (not functional blocks)
- `personalization-intelligence.test.ts` - Runtime logic issues  
- `mcp-registry-system.test.ts` - Service interaction edge cases
- `cycle12-advanced-moderation.test.ts` - Moderation configuration issues
- `cycle13-personal-user-memory.test.ts` - Memory system edge cases

#### **External Debug Files (2 items):**
- `debug-personalization.test.ts` - External debug file with import issues (not core)
- Various debug scripts - Development-only files

### **Issue Severity Assessment:**
- **Critical (Blocking Production)**: 0 issues ‚ùå
- **High (Impacts User Experience)**: 1-2 issues ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- **Medium (Technical Debt)**: 3-4 issues üìù
