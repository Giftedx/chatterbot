- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 (High Priority)**: Servers for enhanced knowledge and real-world information access (Brave Search + File System + Firecrawl).
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 (Medium Priority)**: Specialized servers for structured data and developer tooling (PostgreSQL + SQLite + GitHub).
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4 (Medium Priority)**: Advanced processing tools (Sequential Thinking + Playwright).
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5 (Low Priority)**: Optional enhancement tools (Code Execution + other specialized services).
- ‚úÖ Environment-based server enablement, allowing flexible deployment of features.
- ‚úÖ Validation functions for server configurations, ensuring proper setup.

### 2. Integration Points

#### **Main Bot Integration** (`src/index.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Conditional `MCPManager` initialization based on the `ENABLE_ENHANCED_INTELLIGENCE` environment variable.
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive status reporting on bot startup, detailing active MCP connections.
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown handling with proper cleanup of MCP server connections.
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling for MCP initialization failures, allowing the bot to continue with degraded functionality.

#### **Core Intelligence Integration**
- ‚úÖ `CoreIntelligenceService` (located in `src/services/core-intelligence.service.ts`) is designed to accept an `MCPManager` instance, enabling it to leverage MCP tools.
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility is maintained with existing services, ensuring no disruption to core functionality.
- ‚úÖ All existing bot capabilities are preserved while seamlessly integrating enhanced MCP capabilities.

### 3. Comprehensive Testing

#### **Test Suite** (`src/services/__tests__/mcp-manager-integration.test.ts`)
- ‚úÖ **18/18 tests passing** as confirmed by recent test runs, covering:
  - `MCPManager` initialization and configuration.
  - Server connection management and retry logic.
  - Tool execution for various MCP services (e.g., memory, web search, content extraction).
  - Error handling and graceful degradation scenarios.
  - Status reporting and health checks.
  - Proper shutdown procedures.
  - Backward compatibility verification with the unified architecture.

#### **Integration Validation**
- ‚úÖ All enhanced intelligence tests continue to pass, affirming no breaking changes to existing functionality.
- ‚úÖ Full backward compatibility confirmed, ensuring a smooth transition to MCP-enhanced operations.

## üîß Configuration & Setup

### Environment Variables
To enable and configure MCP integration, set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
# Required for bot operation
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Enable Enhanced Intelligence (activates advanced features including MCP)
ENABLE_ENHANCED_INTELLIGENCE=true
ENABLE_AGENTIC_INTELLIGENCE=true # Recommended to enable agentic features with MCP

# Optional API keys for enhanced capabilities (refer to env.example for full list)
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_search_api_key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key

DATABASE_URL=your_database_url # Used for database features

# Other optional configurations related to MCP servers (e.g., VECTOR_DATABASE_PROVIDER)
# Refer to env.example for a comprehensive list and descriptions.
```

### Phase Deployment Strategy
1. **Start with Phase 1**: Deploy memory and Discord servers to establish critical foundational functionality.
2. **Add Phase 2**: Introduce web search and content extraction for high-value external information access.
