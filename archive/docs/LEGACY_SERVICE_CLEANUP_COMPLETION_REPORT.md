## Technical Achievements

### Service Architecture Modernization
```typescript
// BEFORE: Legacy UnifiedIntelligenceService
const unifiedService = new UnifiedIntelligenceService();
await unifiedService.handleOptinCommand(interaction);

// AFTER: Modern CoreIntelligenceService
const coreIntelligenceService = new CoreIntelligenceService(config);
await coreIntelligenceService.handleInteraction(interaction);
```

### Command System Streamlining
- **Before**: Manual `/optin` command required
- **After**: Automatic opt-in with `/chat` command
- **Impact**: Simplified user experience, reduced friction

### Import System Improvements
```typescript
// BEFORE: Inconsistent imports
import { Service } from './service';

// AFTER: Consistent ESM imports
import { Service } from './service.js';
```
