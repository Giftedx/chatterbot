## Introduction
Implement a phased, agent-orchestrated enhancement of the Discord AI bot across four domains: Foundation, Intelligence, Advanced Features, and Production Scale. The plan ensures deterministic execution with validation gates and zero-regression guardrails.

## Requirements & Constraints
- REQ-001: Preserve ESM import rules (file extensions .js for local imports).
- REQ-002: Maintain passing `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run dev:health`.
- REQ-003: Feature-flag all new subsystems.
- SEC-001: Enforce opt-in for memory features; support delete/export actions.
- CON-001: Do not require Prisma client generation for basic dev/test in restricted envs.

## Implementation Steps
| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Unblock Docker by allowing tsconfig.json in build context | ✅ | 2025-08-12 |
| TASK-002 | Add Prisma MediaFile type shim for restricted envs | ✅ | 2025-08-12 |
| TASK-010 | Integrate Temporal for durable workflow orchestration |  |  |
| TASK-011 | Adopt Vercel AI SDK for TS-first AI flows |  |  |
| TASK-012 | Migrate RAG embeddings to pgvector |  |  |
| TASK-020 | Add LangGraph agentic workflows |  |  |
| TASK-021 | Implement long-term memory subsystem |  |  |
| TASK-022 | Enhance multimodal with GPT-4o |  |  |
| TASK-030 | Introduce CrewAI specialists |  |  |
| TASK-031 | Add real-time streaming backbone |  |  |
| TASK-032 | Harden speech/audio stack |  |  |
| TASK-040 | Add MLOps lifecycle |  |  |
| TASK-041 | Edge AI deployment for low-latency intent |  |  |

- FILE-004: src/types/prisma-model-shim.d.ts
- FILE-005: .dockerignore

## Testing
- TEST-001: Lint/test/health pass after each agent PR.
- TEST-002: Unit tests per feature agent (workflows, vector search adapters, streaming handlers).
- TEST-003: E2E happy path unaffected with feature flags off.

## Risks
- RISK-001: Prisma shim may conflict when real types exist; mitigated by type-only declarations.
- RISK-002: Orchestration complexity; gate behind env flags and validations.
