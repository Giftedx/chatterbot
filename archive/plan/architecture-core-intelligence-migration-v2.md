# Introduction

This plan outlines the migration of the existing Core Intelligence Service to leverage the newly created unified architecture pattern. This migration will integrate the UnifiedMessageAnalysisService, UnifiedMCPOrchestratorService, and UnifiedAnalyticsService into the core intelligence workflow, eliminating remaining service overlaps and establishing a consistent architectural foundation across all intelligence tiers.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing `/chat` command functionality
- **REQ-002**: Preserve all current user-facing features and capabilities
- **REQ-003**: Integrate all three unified core services (Analysis, MCP, Analytics) into Core Intelligence
- **REQ-004**: Maintain ESM module compatibility with .js import extensions
- **REQ-005**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage is maintained or improved
- **SEC-001**: Preserve existing RBAC and permission-based access controls
- **SEC-002**: Maintain all security patterns for MCP tool execution
- **CON-001**: Migration must not introduce breaking changes to dependent services
- **CON-002**: Performance must be maintained or improved during migration
- **CON-003**: All existing environment variable configurations must remain functional
- **GUD-001**: Follow established dependency injection patterns for testability
- **GUD-002**: Maintain modular intelligence service architecture in src/services/intelligence/
- **PAT-001**: Use adapter pattern for smooth transition from legacy to unified services
- **PAT-002**: Implement graceful degradation for all external service dependencies

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Gradual migration approach - Migrate one unified service at a time over multiple releases. This was considered but rejected as it would create temporary architectural inconsistencies and complicate testing.
- **ALT-002**: Create new CoreIntelligenceServiceV2 alongside existing service. This was rejected as it would require maintaining two parallel implementations and complicate the codebase.
- **ALT-003**: Postpone migration until Enhanced Intelligence is also migrated. This was rejected as Core Intelligence is the foundation service and should establish the architectural pattern first.

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: UnifiedMessageAnalysisService must be functional and tested (src/services/core/message-analysis.service.ts)
- **DEP-002**: UnifiedMCPOrchestratorService must be functional and tested (src/services/core/mcp-orchestrator.service.ts)
- **DEP-003**: UnifiedAnalyticsService must be functional and tested (src/services/core/unified-analytics.service.ts)
- **DEP-004**: Existing modular intelligence services must remain compatible (src/services/intelligence/)
- **DEP-005**: ESM module system with .js import extensions for production compatibility
- **DEP-006**: Prisma ORM for database operations must remain functional
- **DEP-007**: MCP tool wrappers in src/mcp/index.ts must remain available

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Migration complexity may introduce subtle bugs in message processing logic. Mitigation: Comprehensive test coverage and gradual rollout approach
- **RISK-002**: Unified service dependencies may create single points of failure. Mitigation: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **RISK-003**: Performance may be impacted by additional service coordination overhead. Mitigation: Performance monitoring and optimization during implementation
- **RISK-004**: Breaking changes in unified service interfaces could impact migration. Mitigation: Interface stability testing and adapter pattern implementation
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Unified services provide equivalent or superior functionality to current implementations
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Modular intelligence services can be adapted to work with unified service outputs without major refactoring
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Existing test infrastructure can be adapted rather than completely rewritten
