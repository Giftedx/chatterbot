This folder contains archived documentation and materials that are no longer authoritative for the current codebase. Prefer README.md and docs/api/ for up-to-date information.

- Use `archive/` as historical reference only. The current features, flags, and commands are defined in `README.md` and implemented under `src/`.
- Environment flags in `archive/` docs may mention `ENABLE_ANALYTICS` or `ENABLE_MCP_INTEGRATION`. The runtime uses `ENABLE_ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD` for the built-in dashboard, and `ENABLE_ENHANCED_INTELLIGENCE` implies MCP integration.
